Petition Ignition
=================

Django app that tracks
a citizen initiative campaign's petition documents
through the entire lifecycle,
in both digital and printed forms:

- Original document (digital)
- Enumerated (digital)
- Enumerated (printed)
- Distributed (printed)
- Collected (printed)
- Scanned (digital)
- Transcribed (electronic)

It also assists with validation
by providing hooks suitable for
integration with locality-specific
voter roster databases.
